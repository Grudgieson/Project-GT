# Project-GT

Project GT is a tool targeted at helping students improve in speed and accuracy of solving short simple adding and subtracting integer problems. This is a fun side passion project and is not meant to be anything crazy fancy, but the team behind this project will push beyond the limits doing the best we can to not only make an efficient but effective tool alongside gaining new skills and talents in regards to the development of this project.
